### About Me

I am a third year computer science & applied mathematics student who has been taking time away from my studies to focus on my own projects. See the sections 'Software Projects' and 'Research Projects' below for an outline of the projects I'm currently working on.

I have too many academic and professional interests to list, but it all (generally) is rooted in my fundamental desire to provide solutions to any problem I'm posed, and to let no question asked go unanswered. Armed with my knowledge based in computational & mathematical science I stand well equipped to fulfill that desire.
To be continued...

### Software Projects

The following is a summary of the notable software projects I'm currently working on:

| # | Alias | Description | Status |
|---|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | "Bushido Freeze" | A tool for securely storing and quickly accessing GitHub personal access tokens. | Development of a proof-of-concept system is nearly complete, then progress towards the first release will be of focus. |
| 2 | | | |

### Research Projects

The following is a summary of the notable research projects (and topics) I'm currently working on:

| # | Alias | Description | Status |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | "NASCAR Analysis" | A statistical analysis of Cup Series racing with the goal of developing accurate predictive technology. | A starting system has been produced and is being actively tested to predict results of races over the 2024 season. Results thus far have been reasonable. |
| 2 | "F1 Analysis" | A statistical analysis of F1 season data with the goal of comparing the last complete season (2023) to seasons previous in search of anomalies. | A database of all F1 season data has been obtained and scripts are being developed to further extract data of interest from the database for analysis. |
| 3 | "Space and Time" | A theoretical (and philisophical) analysis of space, time, and spacetime with the ultimate goal of expanding current knowledge on the subject as much as is possible. | Looking at the universe as a product of three spacial and one time dimensions, and how that equates to 'reality', is where I'm currently at. I expect the perspective to evolve a lot as I work through it, though. |
